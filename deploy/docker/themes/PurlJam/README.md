Purl Jam theme placeholder.

Copy your current UI assets into this theme:
- `Content/` for CSS/JS/images
- `Views/` for Razor views (e.g., `Views/Home/Index.cshtml`)

If you want to keep a mostly static SPA-like layout, map your existing `index.html` into a Razor view
and reference `styles.css` + `app.js` from `Content/`.
